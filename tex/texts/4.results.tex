In this section the results based on the performed user tests and user evaluation are presented. There were 9 test users, whereof 2 females and 7 males. All of them were 21-27 years old and were studying at KTH.

\section{Effectiveness}

\subsection{Timescale} %Add standardavvikelse
Table \ref{avg_time} declares the average time in seconds it took for the users to complete each version of the game. The data shows that it takes 38\% more time to complete the speech version when compared to the text version.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    Speech &   & Text\\
    \midrule
    445.22 &   & 310.22\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Average time to complete the game}\label{avg_time}
\end{table}

\subsection{Commands} %Add standardavvikelse
Table \ref{avg_cmd} declares the average amount of commands used before completing the game. The data shows that it takes almost double (99.67\%) the amount of commands to complete the speech version when compared to the text version. This can also be seen in figure \ref{ideal_cmd}, where the average amount of commands used in each version of the game are compared to the ideal number of commands for each version. The ideal takes in consideration a realistic first playthrough of the game, where the player does not ``magically know'' what items are in each room. Therefore, when entering a room, the command “search room” was used to get the list of items located in the room. No items in the rooms were checked, just taken and used, unless the puzzle involved looking at an item (e.g. searching the desk to find the key). In figure \ref{ideal_cmd} it is also shown that the ideal number of commands are pretty much the same for both versions of the game, making the difference in average number of commands even more significant.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    Speech &   & Text\\
    \midrule
    64.33 &   & 31.22\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Average number of commands used}\label{avg_cmd} % OMG LOOK HERE!!!
\end{table}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{time_cmd} shows the number of commands used over time. As you would expect, the speech version follows the logic of ``the longer time played the more commands used''. However, this is not the case for the text version, where the time played seems irrelevant to the amount of commands used.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/time_cmd.jpg} %width=0.6\textwidth scales the image down to 80 percent of the text-width. Keeps the ratio.

\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{English Confidence} \label{sec:eng_con}
Each user had to rate their spoken and written english between 1-5, where 1 is not good and 5 is fluent. These users were divided into groups and the average amount of commands, time and score were calculated for each group. The result for the amount of commands can be seen in figure \ref{eng_cmd}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/english_cmd.jpg}
  \caption{Average amount of commands used per English level-group}\label{eng_cmd}
\end{figure}

The time is put in seconds and is shown in figure \ref{eng_time}.

The score from the System Usability Scale in relation to the english level is displayed in figure \ref{eng_score}.

%\subsection{User Former Experience}

\section{Satisfaction (SUS)}
Figure \ref{fig:sus_table} shows the average score for each statement after they have been converted according to formulae \ref{eq:convert} in section \ref{sec:sus}.

\end{figure}

The total average score as calculated in formula \ref{eq:sum} for each version can be seen in table \ref{tot_score}.
\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    Speech &   & Text\\
    \midrule
    54.17 &   & 78.06\\
