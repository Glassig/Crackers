Today an increasing amount of systems make use of Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs), which make them easy and efficient to use. The purpose of this research was to gain an increased understanding of the usability of different input methods for NLIs. This was done by implementing two versions of a text-based game with an NLI, where one version used speech as input method and the other used text. Tests were then performed by 9 test users that all played through both versions of the game and then evaluated them individually using the System Usability Scale. It was found that text was better as input method on all aspects. Speech however scored high when the users felt confident in their English competence, acknowledging the possibility of using speech as input method for NLIs.
