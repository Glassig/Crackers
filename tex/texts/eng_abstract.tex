This project has researched the differences in usability between speech and text input for a natural language interface. The research has been conducted by implementing two games with the same game design and mechanic, but with different plots and goals. One of the games had text input and the other had speech input. There were 9 testers that all tried both versions and then evaluated them according to the System Usability Scale. It was found that text input was better on all accounts, however speech scored high when the users felt confident in their english leaving the possibility of open for speech as a method for input in an natural language interface.
