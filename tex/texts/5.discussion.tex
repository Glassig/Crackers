\section{Comparison of Input Methods} %Diskution av resultaten
After having tested both the text version and speech version of the game and having had the test users evaluate the different versions, the results show that text input is more effective than speech input. Even though it presumably consumes more time typing a command than speaking it, the text version took much less time and number of commands to complete. One reason behind this may be that the text version handles more synonyms for the relevant verbs than the speech version does, enabling a greater variation of the commands needed to progress through the game. Another reason may be the difference in how the user input can be registered. When speaking into a microphone there are many variations that can occur, such as different pronunciations, speaking volume, light or dark voice, etc., while typing on a keyboard have no such variations. Due to this the speech version have a higher risk of misunderstanding the user input and may force the user to repeat a command several times before the speech recognizer gets it right.

\section{Sources of Error} %Felkällor
The implementations of Sphinx4 and Stanford POSTagger might not live up tos their full capacity. There might be other or additional ways to implement them to make the game work even better. For example Sphinx4 does provide tools to train the recognizer, which might have made the speech recognition more accurate. Editing the implementation of Stanford POSTagger would presumably not affect the results since it is implemented exactly the same for both versions of the game. Editing the implementation of Sphinx4, however, may cause changes in the results, since it is solely used in the speech version.

All test users had Swedish as their main spoken and written language, which might affect the accuracy of the speech version more than of the text version. When typing a command all that matters is grammar and spelling, but when speaking a command you also need the right pronunciation.

The results are based on tests performed with 9 different users, which may not be enough to validate them. It would be appropriate to perform additional tests in order to strengthen the results. It might also be profitable to perform tests with users of different age groups and technical skills, since all test users have been between 20-30 years old and studying at KTH.
