\section{Comparison of Input Methods} %Diskution av resultaten
After having tested both the text version and speech version of the game and having had the test users evaluate the different versions, the results show that text input is more effective than speech input. Even though it presumably consumes more time typing a command than speaking it, the text version took much less time and number of commands to complete. One reason behind this may be that the text version handles more synonyms for the relevant verbs than the speech version does, enabling a greater variation of the commands needed to progress through the game. Another reason may be the difference in how the user input can be registered. When speaking into a microphone there are many variations that can occur, such as different pronunciations, speaking volume, light or dark voice, etc., while typing on a keyboard have no such variations. Due to this the speech version have a higher risk of misunderstanding the user input and may force the user to repeat a command several times before the speech recognizer gets it right.
