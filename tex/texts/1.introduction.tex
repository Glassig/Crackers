Natural language is the language that is intuitive and natural to the user. The aim of this project is to use gamification in order to acquire better knowledge of how to build a good Natural Language Interface (NLI), which is a field in human-computer interaction. We have implemented a game with different implementations of NLIs, one is a typing based interface where the user give commands using a keyboard and the other is a speech based interface where the user give commands by speaking into a microphone. The game is inspired by other text based adventure-games such as Zork. We are going to compare the different NLI implementations to find which provides the best user experience.

\section{Problem Statement}
Which Natural Language Interface is most user friendly, one using text input or one using speech input?

\section{Scope}
The area of natural languages include various types of communication, such as gestures and touch, but in this project the focus has solely been on text and speech. There also exist different kinds of NLIs for both of these natural languages. For example a text based NLI could use strictly grammatical processing and another could be less strict in this matter. We will however focus on one kind of NLI for both text and speech, since the main goal is to compare the usability of these two input methods.

\section{Purpose}
Natural language is flexible and people need little to no training in how to use it. If it can be successfully translated to a system, it would be possible to create interfaces readily usable by a wider array of people and with a lower entry-level for adaptors. The goal of this project is therefore to gather information about the difference in usability between speech and text based NLIs in order to be able to use the results to build more user friendly NLIs in the future.
