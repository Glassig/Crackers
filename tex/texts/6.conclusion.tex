Text input is a better NLI than speech in most cases. It takes less time to perform tasks, less tries is needed to get the result the user wants and it has an overall higher usability. However, if the user is fairly confident in the language used for the speech-version, they will perform the tasks a lot better and like it at a level close to the text-version. Given that the user-base have the language compatible with the speech interface as their native language, a speech nli is a viable option and could be investigated for that particular usage. For most situations and uses, however, text is prefered and better on an overall basis.
