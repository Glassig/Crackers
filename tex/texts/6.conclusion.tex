Text is better as input method for NLIs than speech in most cases. It takes less time to perform tasks needed, less tries to get the desired outcome and it has an overall higher usability level. However, if the user is confident in it's skills in the language used, they will perform the tasks needed in the speech version with a higher correctness and the user will also be more satisfied with it at a level close to the text version. Given that the user base have the language used within the speech version as their native language, speech is a viable option as input method for NLIs and may be investigated further for that particular usage. For most situations and uses, however, text is much prefered.
