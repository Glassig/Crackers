Text is better as input method for NLIs than speech in most cases. It takes less time to perform tasks needed, less tries to get the desired outcome and it has an overall higher usability level. However, if the user is confident in it's English competence it will perform tasks with a higher correctness in the speech version. The user will also be more satisfied with it, at a level close to the text version. Given that the user base has English as it's native language, speech is a viable option as input method for NLIs and may be investigated further for that particular usage. For most situations and uses, however, text is much prefered.
