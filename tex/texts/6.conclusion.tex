Text is better as input method for NLIs than speech in most cases. It takes less time to perform tasks needed, less tries to get the desired outcome and it has an overall higher usability level. However, if the user is confident in their English competence they will perform tasks with a higher correctness in the speech version. High English confidence also leads to a higher satisfaction with the speech version, at a level close to the text version. Given that the user base has English as their native language, speech is a viable option as input method for NLIs and may be investigated further for that particular usage. For most situations and uses, however, text is much prefered.
